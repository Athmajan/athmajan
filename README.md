üöß WIP :) 

## Hi there üëã, my name is Athmajan.

## üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me
I am from Sri Lanka üá±üá∞, currently living in Oulu Finland üá´üáÆ.  
I am an engineer with over 7 years of experience developing automation and digitization solutions in the telecommunications industry.  
  
I will soon receive a Master's Degree in Wireless Communications Engineering from the University of Oulu, where I have been exploring and studying applications of AI, RL and DL in Wireless Communications Networks.  
  
When I am not building dreams or volunteering to teach kids, you'll find me running outdoors üèÉüèΩ - rain, shine, or snow!,  üì∫ Binge-watching Netflix's finest, and spending quality time with my beautiful wife Jero ü©µ.

## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª I am currently working on

[Adaptive multi-agent systems by modeling other agents' communications and actions.](https://github.com/ICONgroupCWC/chase-and-capture)  
- Discrete State/Action Spaces

- Continuous State/Action Spaces
 Work in Progress - I am extending the discrete results to continuous state and action spaces using the MPE gym environment.

## üìö I am currently learning
- [NVIDIA Sionna](https://nvlabs.github.io/sionna/index.html)
  ![NVIDIA](https://img.shields.io/badge/NVIDIA-Sionna-76B900?style=flat&logo=nvidia&logoColor=white)
  ![MATLAB](https://img.shields.io/badge/MATLAB-Channel%20Estimation-blue?style=flat&logo=mathworks&logoColor=white)  
  As a part of the coursework for 521322S Telecommunication Engineering Project, I am leveraging the open-source library to simulate the physical layer of wireless systems.
  Specifically, I am attempting to implement OFDM signal with sync and explore channel and data estimation comparing results with implementations with MATLAB.

## Reinforcement Learning
- [World Models](https://github.com/ICONgroupCWC/worldmodels-ARM)
  Original implementation by [ctallec](https://github.com/ctallec/world-models)  
  My contribution is the compatibility with Apple Silicon processors.  
  
  Pytorch implementation of the "World Models" for ARM processors (Apple Silicon).
  I reimplemented the Paper: Ha and Schmidhuber, [World Models](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1207631) compatible with Apple Silicon processors.
  On the right, you can see the agent's regenerated dream of the real observation (left) by using the VAE.

- [Multi Robot Repair](https://github.com/Athmajan/multi-robot-repair)
  This is a work in progress. I am developing the simulator described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04222) - Multiagent Rollout and Policy Iteration for POMDP with Application to Multi-Robot Repair Problems.

- Cleanup and Harvest - PPO Agent in MARL
  This is a self-study exploration of how to train PPO agents in an agent setting.
  On the left you can see the PPO agents at work and on the right side compares to random actions.
