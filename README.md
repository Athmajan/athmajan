üöß WIP :) 

## Hi there üëã, my name is Athmajan.

## üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me
I am from Sri Lanka üá±üá∞, currently living in Oulu Finland üá´üáÆ.  
I am an engineer with over 7 years of experience developing automation and digitization solutions in the telecommunications industry.  
  
I will soon receive a Master's Degree in Wireless Communications Engineering from the University of Oulu, where I have been exploring and studying applications of AI, RL and DL in Wireless Communications Networks.  
  
When I am not building dreams or volunteering to teach kids, you'll find me running outdoors üèÉüèΩ - rain, shine, or snow!,  üì∫ Binge-watching Netflix's finest, and spending quality time with my beautiful wife Jero ü©µ.

## üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª I am currently working on
- Discrete State/Action Spaces
[Adaptive multi-agent systems by modeling other agents' communications and actions.](https://github.com/ICONgroupCWC/chase-and-capture)

- Continuous State/Action Spaces
 I am extending the discrete results to continuous state and action spaces.

## üìö I am currently learning




## Reinforcement Learning
- [World Models](https://github.com/ICONgroupCWC/worldmodels-ARM)
  Pytorch implementation of the "World Models" for ARM processors (Apple Silicon).
  I reimplemented the Paper: Ha and Schmidhuber, [World Models](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1207631) compatible for Apple Silicon processors.

- [Multi Robot Repair](https://github.com/Athmajan/multi-robot-repair)
  This is a work in progress. I am developing the simulator described in the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04222) - Multiagent Rollout and Policy Iteration for POMDP with Application to Multi-Robot Repair Problems.
