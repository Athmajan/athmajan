🚧 WIP :) 

## Hi there 👋, my name is Athmajan.

## 🙋🏽‍♂️ About Me
I am from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰, currently living in Oulu Finland 🇫🇮.  
I am an engineer with over 7 years of experience developing automation and digitization solutions in the telecommunications industry.  
  
I will soon receive a Master's Degree in Wireless Communications Engineering from the University of Oulu, where I have been exploring and studying applications of AI, RL and DL in Wireless Communications Networks.  
  
When I am not building dreams or volunteering to teach kids, you'll find me running outdoors 🏃🏽 - rain, shine, or snow!,  📺 Binge-watching Netflix's finest, and spending quality time with my beautiful wife Jero 🩵.

## 👨🏽‍💻 I am currently working on
[Adaptive multi-agent systems by modeling other agents' communications and actions.](https://github.com/ICONgroupCWC/chase-and-capture)

## ⨡ My Projects

Pytorch implementation of the "World Models" for ARM processors (Apple Silicon)
I reimplemented the Paper: Ha and Schmidhuber, "World Models", 2018. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1207631 with a focus on updating dependencies for compatibility for Apple Silicon processors.
