## Hi there 👋, my name is Athmajan.

## 🙋🏽‍♂️ About Me
I am from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰, currently living in Oulu Finland 🇫🇮.
I am passionate about exploring and studying applications of AI and RL in Wireless Communications Networks.
When I am not building dreams or volunteering to teach kids, you'll find me running outdoors 🏃🏽 - rain, shine, or snow!,  📺 Binge-watching Netflix's finest, and spending quality time with my beautiful wife Jero 🩵.

## 👨🏽‍💻 I am currently working on
Adaptive multi-agent systems by modeling other agents' communications and actions.
